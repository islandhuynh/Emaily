<b>Introduction</b>

Emaily is a project I developed for Stephen Grider’s “Node with React: Fullstack Web Development'' course. It is a web application where users can purchase the service of sending out surveys to recipients. 

<b>How it works</b>

When signed in, a dashboard is presented, showing the user all the surveys (if any) they have sent out along with the responses of the recipients. Users may send out surveys by using purchasable credits. Users may purchase credits by clicking on the “ADD CREDITS” button and entering in their credit card information. To send a survey, users may click the plus button. They will be prompted to fill out a form with information on the survey they would like to send out. Once they click “next”, they will be asked to verify if the information they have entered is desired before submitting. The survey will then be sent out to the recipients via email.
